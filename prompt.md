 how should i architect an AI assistant app for school and career orientation that is based on data scrapped from school websites and orientation websites. the app will store unstructured data from the web but i think also structured data may be useful. based on the data stored about the user and using vector search on the scraped data the ai should be able to suggest roadmaps to the user
